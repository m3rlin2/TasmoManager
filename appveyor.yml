version: 1.0.{build}

# This file defines all the magic to test the build on every push to GitHub with the help of appveyor.com
# We use different (virtual) build environments that work sequentially and provide their artifacts.
# The artifacts of every push/build are available in appveyor for 6 months from build.
# Artifacts of tagged pushes ("unstable" or release number) are deployed into the GitHub release.
